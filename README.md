### **`Install Localy 🧑🏼‍🔧`**
1. install dependency. `npm install`  
1. copy .env.example and rename it into .env (`cp .env.example .env`)
1. ajust config in .env

### **`Running App 👟`**
`npm start`  

### **`Flow Development 🏗`**
During the development cycle, a variety of supporting branches are used:  

- feature/* -- feature branches are used to develop new features for the upcoming releases. May branch off from develop and must merge into develop.
- hotfix/* -- hotfix branches are necessary to act immediately upon an undesired status of master. May branch off from master and must merge into master and develop.

Creating a new feature  

1. create new branch from master. ex: `feature/name-of-feature`.
1. write your code.
1. don't forget to run `npm run lint` to check standardize code or `npm run lintfix` to auto fix non-standard code.
1. commit & push your work to the same named branch on the server.
1. create PR into development branch for testing in dev server.
1. if its pre-production ready then create PR from the same branch into staging. **DON'T PR FROM DEVELOPMENT BRANCH!**
1. if ready to production then create PR from the same branch into master/production. **DON'T PR FROM DEVELOPMENT BRANCH OR STAGING!**

### **`Deployment 🚀`**
This flow of deployment using Git Flow with 3 main branches  

- master -- this branch contains production code. All development code is merged into master in sometime.
- staging -- this branch is a nearly exact replica of a production environment for software testing.
- development/dev -- this branch contains pre-production code. When the features are finished then they are merged into develop.
